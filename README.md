## SSL for GitHub pages (important!)
It is not possible to install custom SSL certificates on GitHub pages services. The germanfica.com domain name was secured by GitHub pages hosting provider already (it's always like that). In this case, it will not be possible to use the certificate from Namecheap on the website hosted on these services.
